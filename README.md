## 🚀 Features

- **Time-based Timer:** Input a specific time in `HH:mm:ss` format to start the countdown.
- **Countdown Timer:** Set a countdown duration and watch the time decrease to zero.
- **Custom Color Selection:** Choose a preferred color to be applied to the timer display.
- **Color-changing Effect:** Upon reaching zero, a secondary window appears with a background that alternates between two colors, providing a visual cue for the timer's completion.
