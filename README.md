Timer and Color Change Application
This Java-based application combines a countdown timer with a fun visual effect. Users can set either a specific time or
countdown timer, choose a custom color, and watch as the timer reaches zero, triggering a color-changing effect in a secondary window.

Key Features:

Time-based Timer: Enter a specific time (in HH:mm:ss format) and the app will notify you when the time is up.

Countdown Timer: Set a countdown and watch the time count down to zero.

Custom Color Selection: Choose your preferred color to be applied to the timer display.

Color-changing Effect: Once the timer finishes, a second window appears, featuring a background color that 
alternates based on the color you selected and the speed you set.

Adjustable Speed: Change how fast the color changes in the second window by adjusting the speed slider.

This application is perfect for those who need a visual timer with some interactive flair!
